# Authzmanager
This Authzmanager is used for managing OAuth2 client, role, organization and user profile.

This application is deployed at [authzmanager](https://authzmanager.sonam.cloud).  I have attached documentation
about how to create OAuth2 client and use it in general on my [about](https://sonamsamdupkhangsar.github.io/my-authorization-server/about/) page.
